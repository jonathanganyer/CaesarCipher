(1) Introduction
-----------------
Caesar Cipher is an open-source cryptography program for the caesar cipher algorithm written in C. 

Caesar Cipher is able to convert plaintext to ciphertext and vice-versa. Users can specify whether they want to encrypt/decrypt the input text
and give the linear shifted key value. Text should be upper/lowercase letters only. Since the caesar cipher is an alphabetical cipher, including
numbers will cause wrong outputs.

Caesar Cipher will run on any platform having a working GCC compiler or can run *.exe files. It was created in Codeblocks IDE has been tested on 
Windows 7 x64. Feedback regarding installation and usage on other platforms will be included in future manuals.
